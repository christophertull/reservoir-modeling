resevoir-modeling
=================
  
Basic modeling of time series data acquired from the California Data Exchange Center

Stations with the desired sensor types were first scraped using input.io. 

Later datasets will be scraped using beautifulsoup.

Once time series have been aquired, a number of time series models will be tryed in order to 
predict resevoir levels based on attributes like 
* inflow
* outflow
* precipitation.
